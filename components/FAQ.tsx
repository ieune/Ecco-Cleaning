    question: "Do I need to be home during the cleaning?",
    answer: "No, you don't! Most of our Richmond clients provide us with a key code or leave a key in a secure lockbox. We are fully bonded and insured for your peace of mind."
  },
  {
    question: "What cleaning supplies do you use?",
    answer: "We bring our own professional-grade, eco-friendly supplies and equipment (vacuums, mops, etc.). If you have specific products you'd prefer us to use, just let us know!"
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the service?",
    answer: "Your happiness is our priority. If you aren't 100% satisfied, call us within 24 hours and we'll come back to re-clean the specific areas for free. That's our Ecco Satisfaction Guarantee."
  },
  {
    question: "Are you pet friendly?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We love pets. We just ask that aggressive pets be secured, but generally, our team is very comfortable working around cats and dogs."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I pay?",
    answer: "For your convenience, we accept Zelle, Venmo, check, and cash. Payment is due upon completion of the service, once you are completely satisfied."
